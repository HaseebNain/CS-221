PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This assignment called for the use of the Eclipse debugging tool to analyze 

INCLUDED FILES:

 * README - this file
 
BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 * The program worked correctly on Windows computers. I was able to initiate the debugging mode and analyze both the QuickSort and the Recognizer classes.
 
PROJECT DESIGN NOTES:

 * The content of the java classes was not changed in anyway whatsoever. The only impact I had on these classes was the use of breakpoints.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING NOTES:

 * In order to analyze the QuickSort to find the values of the various variables I found method calls that used the interested variables as parameters.
 	-The points of interest were specifically lines 33, 35, and 37.
 * The following data presents the observations as a result of the debugging.
 
Call		table		first		last		pivot		pivIndex
1		17		0		49		83		41
2		17		0		40		73		38		
3		17		0		37		11		2
4		17		0		1		11		1
5		17		0		37		11		2
6		17		3		37		15		4
7		17		5		37		35		19
8		17		5		18		30		16

 *For the Recognizer.java class, the order of the method calls can be seen below, as well as the value for lookahead:
 Method:	pop()		bop()		boop()		pop()		bop()		boop()	
 Lookahead:	(		x		)		[		z		,		
 
 * In order to find the value of the lookahead variable, I placed a conditional point at line 100, after when all the comparisons have been done.
 * The condition I used for my conditional breakpoint is as follows:
 	-lookahead == 'y'
